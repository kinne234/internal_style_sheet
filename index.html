<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<hr>

<!--See two links below-->

<h2>A place I would like to visit:</h2>
<p>I would really enjoy traveling to <a href="https://www.tourismthailand.org/home" target="_blank">Thailand</a>. I studied abroad in Europe and had the chance to explore many different countries there.<br> I want to visit a new continent for my next adventure, and Thailand has always been on my bucket list of Asian countries to visit.</p>

<h2>A person I admire (past or present):</h2>

<p>If I could meet someone I admire, it would have to be <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Turner">Sophie Turner</a> from Game of Thrones. Many people think that we look alike, so it would be cool to meet my doppleganger in real life.</p>
